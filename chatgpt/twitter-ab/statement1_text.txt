@londonfox2030 @CobaltEternity @daryazorka Most GOP seem prone to be easily swayed to abandon reason, particularly by a manipulative demagogue. Look what happened with Trump.

Whether Trump or DeSantis in 2024, I think all bets are off for continued US support of Ukraine. That‚Äôs why we need to escalate so üá∫üá¶ wins SOON.
Running third party makes him a traitor.

If he loses the primary, he must support the winner.

Keep in mind as I always told you, Trump is Narcissistic.
