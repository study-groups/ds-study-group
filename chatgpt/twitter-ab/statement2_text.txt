 Republicans have some great potential candidates out there. The country has to go beyond President Trump away from the everyday controversies we see and hear about the former president.

@thecjpearson Trump and his team prob have tried very hard to not let that list get released
@KevinTartis @AlexEpstein @nytimes Yes, especially biofuel. It accounts for about 10% of farm revenue. Sugar tariffs keep cheap imports out. etc

But things like US dairy, are cheap on the world stage, because of efficiency. Trump reduced Canuck dairy costs more than any PM, by including some dairy in NAFTA.
@PoliticalBlade DeSantis did grave damage to the agenda of sexualizing children.  The media has gone silent about it.  The cabal wants him. He is a newbie they think they can control. Haven‚Äôt people noticed how much the cabal keeps ‚Äúimpeaching‚Äù Trump? He‚Äôs an existential threat.
