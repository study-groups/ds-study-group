# Leaning Python

When reasoning about how a program works, consider three things:

1. Variable type  (integer?, string? float", bool?, array?, list? set?)
2. Variable shape (is it a compound type like an array? How long? What does each element of the array look like?)
3. Function signature (input types and output types)

## Getting started

Start with the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/). There you will find:

1. [The official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
2. [Library Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
3. [Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
4. [Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)
5. [Langauge Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/)

### Digging deeper

- [statsmodel](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html): is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. It is the geeky cousin to scikit-learn. Good for learnig 

- [type annotations]{https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html} are good.

- Note that everything in Python is an Object. Jake VanderPlas gives a great explaination of Python symantics 
(meaning of statements, not it's syntax).
