# Leaning Python

When reasoning about how a program works, consider three things:

1. Variable type  (integer?, string? float", bool?, array?, list? set?)
2. Variable shape (is it a compound type like an array? How long? What does each element of the array look like?)
3. Function signature (input types and output types)

## Getting started

Start with the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/). There you will find:

1. [The official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
2. [Library Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
3. [Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
4. [Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)
5. [Langauge Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/)

## Digging deeper
t
- [Statistics for Hackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA) Jake Vanderplus's nice bridge between
Python and statistics.

- [type annotations]{https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html} are good.

- Note that everything in Python is an Object. Jake VanderPlas gives a great explaination of Python symantics 
(meaning of statements, not it's syntax).
